# AstroLibrary - Scientific Astrology & Physics Library

## Overview
A comprehensive library combining rigorous physics simulations with evidence-based astrological research methodologies. This library addresses the traditional lack of scientific validation in astrology by implementing statistical analysis, machine learning, and standardized research protocols.

## Scientific Methodology

### 1. Evidence-Based Approach
- **Statistical Analysis**: Pearson correlation analysis between celestial positions and personality traits
- **Large-Scale Data Collection**: Framework for collecting 10,000+ birth charts with corresponding psychological assessments
- **Control Groups**: Support for controlled studies with statistical power analysis
- **Replication Studies**: Built-in support for study replication and meta-analysis

### 2. Astronomical Accuracy
- **JPL-Compatible Calculations**: Precise planetary position calculations
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Framework for NASA/ESA API integration
- **Sidereal vs Tropical**: Support for both astronomical coordinate systems
- **Retrograde Motion**: Accurate modeling of apparent planetary retrograde motion

### 3. Psychological Validation
- **Big Five Personality Model**: Integration with standard psychological assessments
- **Standardized Metrics**: Quantifiable personality trait measurements (0-100 scale)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Statistical confidence intervals for all correlations
- **Blind Testing**: Framework for double-blind validation studies

### 4. Machine Learning Integration
- **Prediction Models**: Random forest and neural network foundations
- **Feature Engineering**: 20+ astrological features for model training
- **Cross-Validation**: Built-in model validation and accuracy testing
- **Continuous Learning**: Framework for model improvement with new data

## Key Features

### Physics Engine
- Comprehensive vector mathematics (2D/3D)
- Classical mechanics (kinematics, dynamics, energy, momentum)
- Wave physics and thermodynamics
- Electromagnetism and quantum mechanics basics
- Relativity calculations
- Particle physics simulation

### Astrological Calculations
- Zodiac sign determination with elements and qualities
- Planetary position calculations (simplified, expandable to JPL ephemeris)
- Astrological aspects (conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition)
- Birth chart generation with houses and angles
- Statistical correlation analysis

### Research Framework
- **Sample Size Calculation**: Power analysis for study design
- **Data Structures**: Organized storage for birth charts, personality data, and life events
- **Validation Protocols**: Scientific study design and replication support
- **Meta-Analysis Tools**: Combining results across multiple studies

## Example Usage

```astro
// Calculate birth chart
let birth_date = julian_day_number(1990.0, 6.0, 15.0)
let sun_position = calculate_sun_position(birth_date)
let sun_sign = degrees_to_zodiac_sign(sun_position.longitude)

// Statistical analysis
let correlation = calculate_correlation(planetary_positions, personality_scores, sample_size)
print("Correlation: r = ${correlation.correlation_coefficient}, p = ${correlation.p_value}")

// Research design
let required_sample = design_validation_study(0.3, 0.8, 0.05)
print("Required sample size: ${required_sample}")
```

## Research Goals

1. **Establish Statistical Significance**: Identify measurable correlations between celestial positions and personality traits
2. **Predictive Accuracy**: Develop models achieving >70% accuracy for major life event prediction
3. **Replication**: Conduct multiple independent studies with consistent methodology
4. **Open Science**: Provide open-source tools for researchers worldwide
5. **Meta-Analysis**: Combine findings across studies for robust conclusions
